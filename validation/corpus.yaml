# Corpus definitions for Tier 1 regression testing.
#
# Each entry specifies a git repo, revision, compilation flags, and a
# representative subset of source files to analyze. The actual corpus
# list used by run_corpus.sh is hardcoded in that script — this file
# serves as the canonical reference for all available corpora.
#
# To add a new corpus:
#   1. Add an entry here.
#   2. Add a corresponding run_external_corpus call in run_corpus.sh.
